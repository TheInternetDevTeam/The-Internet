Unless you store bunsetsu boundaries and yumi (phonetic reading), along with the original text, you can pretty much forget about automatic transliteration of Japanese (or Chinese, for that matter).
*/
/*
100% accurate transliteration, or transcription, like 100% accurate machine translation, is extremely difficult to achieve.

Systems do exist which can take a paragraph of kana and convert it into kanji, or vice versa. The accuracy is about 98%, on average.

There are also machine translation systems working on PCs that can achieve readable, if not grammatically correct English and Japense.

Resource usage for the above systems is still fairly high: about on par with a typical Microsoft application, in fact :P

It's not impossible, not impractical, but not 100% perfect either. Sound familiar?
